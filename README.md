# reporting-unified [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eResearchSA/reporting-unified.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/eResearchSA/reporting-unified)
Flask applications for accessing eRSA reporting databases.

## Deployment

The package only works with PostgreSQL because it uses:

* UUID
* INET
* MACADDR

### Set up a database for a package in development

0. Modify `prepare_db.sql.demo` and save as `prepare_db.sql` then run `sudo -u postgres psql -f prepare_db.sql`
0. Create config.py file
0. Activate env
0. Create tables from either command:

  ```shell
  bin/ersa_reporting-prep ersa_reporting.PACKAGE
  # or
  export APP_SETTINGS=config.py
  bin/unified-apis-prep PACKAGE
  ```

### `unified` package

The package can be served by, for example, __nginx__ (proxy) + __gunicorn__.

If deploy to a CentOS 7 cloud instance, [script](bin/unified-centos7.sh)
can be used to prepare the instance with __nginx__ and __gunicorn__ if one
application is being deployed. For multiple application deployment, run
[service_generator.sh](bin/service_generator.sh) and then [gconf_generator.sh](bin/gconf_generator.sh).
To finish off, in `/usr/lib/ersa_reporting`, create a `config-PACKAGE.py`
file described in this document and [example](config.py.example).

Access and error logs of gunicorn of an application are saved under `/var/log/gunicorn/`.

An application's log is named as _application_.log, e.g. __'hnas.log'__ in
`/usr/lib/ersa_reporting`. Where this log is saved can be configured in
`config-PACKAGE.py` with key `LOG_DIR`.

Example of `gunicorn` configuration file generated by [gconf_generator.sh](bin/gconf_generator.sh):

```python
timeout = 7200
proc_name = PACKAGE
workers = 2
PDIRfile = "/run/gunicorn/PACKAGE.PDIR"
raw_env = ["APP_SETTINGS=config-PACKAGE.py"]
accesslog = "/var/log/gunicorn/PACKAGE_access.log"
errorlog = "/var/log/gunicorn/PACKAGE_error.log"
loglevel = "info"
```

### `ersa-reporting` package - to be deprecated

The package can be served by, for example, __nginx__ (proxy) + __gunicorn__.

If deploy to a CentOS 7 cloud instance, [script](centos7.sh) can be used to set up __nginx__ and __gunicorn__.

The log of an application is currently hard-coded to be saved in
`/var/log/gunicorn/` which assumes `gunicorn` is configured to save logs to there.

An application's log is named as ersa_reporting._application_.log, e.g. __'ersa_reporting.hnas.log'__.

This package contains multiple applications. Main package `ersa_reporting`
expects `config.py` to have relevant settings:
* SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS
* SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
* ERSA_REPORTING_PACKAGE
* ERSA_AUTH_TOKEN

### configure `gunicorn`

The packge needs to talk to a database so there is a configuration file for __gunicorn__ to use
which is listed below in the example of __hnas.conf__. It also can be generated by a script like
[gconf_example](gconf_generator.sh.example). Each web api application served by `gunicorn` can be configured by a conf
file like this:

```python

raw_env = ["ERSA_REPORTING_PACKAGE=hnas", "ERSA_DEBUG=True",
           "ERSA_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:pass@host/db",
           "ERSA_AUTH_TOKEN=DEBUG_TOKEN"]
timeout = 7200
proc_name = "hnas"
workers = 2
pidfile = "/run/gunicorn/hnas.pid"
accesslog = "/var/log/gunicorn/hnas_access.log"
errorlog = "/var/log/gunicorn/hnas_error.log"
loglevel = "info"
```

## Development - `unified` package - the replacement of `ersa-reporting`

Applications in `unified` get their configurations from the file set
in environment variable `APP_SETTINGS`. See [example](config.py.example)
for common settings of an API application. For other applications, they
can have different keys.

A basic `config.py` should have these keys:
* SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS
* SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
* ERSA_REPORTING_PACKAGE
* ERSA_AUTH_TOKEN (optional for development)
* DEBUG = True (optional, make Flask give more error messages)

### run an `unified` application
To interact with the package:

```python
import time
import os
os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'] = 'config-xfs.py'
from unified.models.xfs import Snapshot, Filesystem, Usage, Owner, Host
start = time.time()
x = Snapshot.summarise(1452930321, 1452676846)
end = time.time()
print(end - start)

```

To serve an application for testing:

```shell
# run dev instance by Flask
export APP_SETTINGS=config-xfs.py
export FLASK_APP=unified/apis/xfs.py
flask run -h 0.0.0.0 --reload

# run dev instance by Gunicorn
gunicorn -e APP_SETTINGS=config-xfs.py --access-logfile - -b 0.0.0.0:5000 unified.apis.xfs:app
```

## Scipts

### Ingest

The script needs `boto` package installed.

#### TODO: put description of ingest here

### Biller script `biller.py` - FIXME with unified models

This script is for generating bills directly. It has a few custom Flask
commands. For generating Nova bills, it needs credential for accessing
Nectar Keystone (not from reporting database). As with other API
applications, the `config.py` should have all keys in those applications,
and at least these two keys:

```python

NECTAR_USER = "username"
NECTAR_USER_PASS = "password"
```

### Usage script

Default config is `config.json`. You can use other by calling with `--conf`.
The structure of `config.json` looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "Nova": {
    "APP": "comm-config.py",
    "workers": 3,
    "crm": { "url": "crm" }
  },
  "Hpc": {
    "APP": "hpc-config.py",
    "crm": { "url": "crm" }
  }
}
```

There are two ways to define a time period for usage calculation:

1. by year and month
```python
python calculator.py -y 2016 -m 8 nova
```

2. or by start and end:
```python
python calculator.py -s 20160801 -e 20160831 nova
```

### Tests

Tests are run through unittest package. They need a running API application
to test against and `auth_token` to connect to it. `auth_token` can be the
development server token set in config file set by `APP_SETTINGS` by
`ERSA_AUTH_TOKEN` or a valid token in other set ups.


```
python -m unittest usage/tests/test_calculator.py
python -m unittest usage.tests.test_calculator.TestUsages.test_filename_of_usage_save
python -m unittest unified.models.tests.test_xfs
python -m unittest unified.tests.test_xfs
```
